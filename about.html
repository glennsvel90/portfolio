        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Glenn Velupillai! This is my website where I share all of my favorite work. </p>
      </section>
        <p>I’m from New York City and I love everything about the web. I have been a self-taught programmer for 2 years. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic-looking websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional volunteer Math tutor, and I am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
        <p>I love to share resources to make the world a better place. I believe in the Ubuntu mission: "We are One." The purpose of life is to do the best we can to positively impact lives in ways that resonate with our being and to spread love and peace. To help fulfill this mission
        I have been excitedly building apps that help solve community problems. I am a problem solver and a critical thinker who aims to only do my best. When I'm not building software, I enjoy exercising, indulging in self-development resources, inspiring others to do their best, and planting hope in people's hearts.
